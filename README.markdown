# StarExec Web Interface

This is the documentation for [StarExec's](https://www.starexec.org/) web interface

## Downloading

If you just want to download the compiled PDF documentation, that document can
be found in the [releases section](https://github.com/StarExec/Web-Interface/releases/latest).

## Building

Building requires [**pdflatex**](https://ctan.org/pkg/pdftex) and a fairly full
TeX installation. If all required packages are installed, a PDF can be generated
using:

```sh
make PDF
```
