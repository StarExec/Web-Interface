\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Using the URLs}

Except for noted exceptions, URLs documented in the functions below are suffixes of the following URL, which points to the secure resources of Starexec.
\\\url{https://www.starexec.org/starexec/secure/}\\

The largest exception to this is that all URLs that begin with ``services'' do not have the ``secure'' prefix. So, any URL that begins with services/ is a suffix of the following URL.
\\\url{https://www.starexec.org/starexec/}\\

Other exceptions are noted where applicable in the function documentation.


\section{Logging In}

To be able to access Starexec resources, you will need to log into Starexec and maintain a secure channel. Logging in is a multistep protocol, with 3 main steps. First, authorization works on a challenge-based system, which means you cannot log in until you request a secure resource. Next, you must provide your username and password, and finally, you will access a secure resource.

\subsection*{First Step -- Requesting a Secure Resource}

\begin{description}
\item [URL] \relurl{index.jsp}
\item [Method] GET
\item [Parameter Encoding] N/A
\item [Returns] The login page
\item [Return Cookies] \

	\begin{description}
	\item [JSESSIONID] \type{Integer} On success, contains a session ID that you will need to use in later steps.
	\end{description}
\end{description}

\subsection*{Second Step -- Providing Login Credentials}

\begin{description}
\item [URL] \relurl{j\_security\_check}
\item [Method] POST
\item [Parameter Encoding] application/x-www-form-urlencoded
\item [Parameters] \
    \begin{description}
    \item [j\_username] \type{String} Your username
    \item [j\_password] \type{String} Your password
    \item [cookieexists] \type{Boolean} Should be set to false for web API calls
    \end{description}

\item [Description] Logs you into Starexec. You must provide the JSESSIONID you acquired in the previous steps.
\item [Returns] A jSON string containing a status object
\end{description}

\subsection*{Third Step -- Accessing Secure Resources}

\begin{description}
\item [URL] \relurl{index.jsp}
\item [Method] GET
\item [Parameter Encoding] N/A
\item [Returns] The login page
\item [Return Cookies] \
	\begin{description}
	\item [JSESSIONID] \type{Integer} On success, contains a new session ID. You must begin using this new session ID for all subsequent interactions.
	\end{description}
\end{description}

\section{Maintaining a Session}
After you have logged in, you must maintain a session for as long as you want to make requests to the secure resources of Starexec. To maintain a session, your HTTP requests should have the following header keys with the appropriate values.

\begin{description}
\item [Cookie] \type{String} Should contain a string of the form ``killmenothing; JSESSIONID='' + your JSESSIONID obtained when logging in.
\item [Connection] \type{String} Should be ``keep-alive''
\item [Accept-Language] \type{String} Should be ``en-US,en;q=0.5''
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item [addBench] \type{Boolean} Whether default permissions for this space should include adding benchmarks
\item [addJob] \type{Boolean} Whether default permissions for this space should include adding jobs
\item [addSolver] \type{Boolean} Whether default permissions for this space should include adding solvers
